//! I/O subsystem interfaces.
//!
//! This module defines the abstract interfaces presented by the I/O subsystem:
//! - [`IOLoop`] advances a concrete backend and retires completed work
//! - [`IO`] submits new operations and allocates backend objects
//! - [`IOFile`] and [`IOSocket`] expose file and socket capabilities
//! - one concrete completion type per operation kind (e.g. [`RecvCompletion`])
//!   provides the caller-owned record for one in-flight operation
//!
//! The subsystem is completion-based. There is one concrete completion type
//! per operation kind ([`RecvCompletion`], [`SendCompletion`], ...). The
//! caller prepares and owns the matching one, passes it to the operation
//! (e.g. [`IO::mkdir`], [`IOSocket::recv`]), and later observes the typed
//! result in the same object. The backend translates abstract operations
//! into concrete kernel work, advances them to completion, and writes the
//! typed result.
//!
//! Separating [`IOLoop`] from [`IO`] preserves a clear distinction between
//! driving the backend and issuing work into it. A single implementation may
//! provide both interfaces, but the contracts remain conceptually distinct:
//! one interface progresses the subsystem, the other requests service from it.
