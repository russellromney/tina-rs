# Changelog

This file records completed work.

## Unreleased

### Phase Sputnik

- Added the `tina` trait crate as the shared vocabulary layer.
- Added `Isolate`, `Effect`, `Mailbox`, `Shard`, `Context`, `Address`,
  `Outbound`, and `ChildDefinition`.
- Chose a closed `Effect` enum with per-isolate payload types.
- Added docs, compile-fail tests, and downstream-style integration tests for
  the trait surface.

### Phase Pioneer

- Added shared supervision policy types in `tina`, including restart policy,
  restart-budget accounting, and child restart classification.
- Added `tina-mailbox-spsc`, a bounded single-producer/single-consumer mailbox
  implementation.
- Proved mailbox FIFO order, boundedness, explicit `Full` and `Closed` errors,
  and no hidden overflow queue with black-box tests.
- Added Loom coverage for producer/consumer interleavings, close/send races,
  close/recv behavior, wraparound, and slot reuse.
- Added drop-accounting and allocation-accounting tests to keep mailbox claims
  narrow and evidence-backed.
- Documented the DST boundary and the runtime-enforced SPSC contract.

### Phase Mariner

- Added `tina-runtime`, a small in-progress runtime with a deterministic
  event trace and causal links.
- Added single-shard stepping and local same-shard `Send` dispatch in
  registration order.
- Added local same-shard `Spawn` dispatch with runtime-owned mailbox creation,
  deterministic child IDs, and later-round child execution.
- Added runtime-owned direct parent-child lineage for root registrations and
  spawned children, with crate-private proof support for restart-oriented
  follow-up slices.
- Added a typed runtime ingress API so external code can send to registered and
  spawned isolates without holding raw mailboxes.
- Added stop-and-abandon semantics: when an isolate stops, buffered messages are
  drained in FIFO order, dropped, and traced as `MessageAbandoned`.
- Added panic-capture semantics: an unwinding handler panic becomes
  `HandlerPanicked`, then `IsolateStopped`, and the runtime continues the rest
  of the round deterministically.
- Added runtime tests for trace-core behavior, local send dispatch, and
  stop-and-abandon determinism.
- Added runtime tests for panic capture, post-panic abandonment, preserved
  programmer-error panics, and same-round continuation after panic.
- Added runtime tests for spawn dispatch, typed ingress backpressure, cross-shard
  ingress panics, and zero-capacity spawn rejection.
- Added runtime unit tests for direct parent-child lineage, nested spawn edges,
  and lineage survival across stop/panic.
- Added address-liveness semantics: `Address<M>` now includes a generation,
  runtime send traces include target generation, and stale known generations
  fail visibly as `Closed` instead of targeting a current incarnation.
- Added restartable child records: `RestartableChildDefinition<I>` records a
  factory-backed restart recipe, and `Runtime` stores private child
  metadata for future `RestartChildren` execution.
- Added `RestartChildren` execution for direct child records: restartable
  children are replaced with fresh isolate incarnations, non-restartable
  children are skipped visibly, and restart traces now support deterministic
  causal tree branching.
- Added `tina-supervisor` with `SupervisorConfig`.
- Added supervised panic restart in `tina-runtime`: configured parents
  apply `RestartPolicy` and runtime-lifetime `RestartBudget` state when direct
  children panic.
- Added generated-history runtime property tests for deterministic traces,
  causal-link validity, visible send outcomes, and no accidental handling after
  stop.
- Added an assertion-backed task-dispatcher proof package for the single-shard
  runtime, covering `OneForOne`, `OneForAll`, `RestForOne`, budget exhaustion,
  stale-address closure, and repeated-run determinism.
- Added a runnable `task_dispatcher` example that mirrors the tested workload:
  dispatcher-owned task ingress, registry-isolate address resolution, worker
  panic/restart, and later work continuing through replacement workers.
- Extended `runtime_properties.rs` with generated dispatcher workloads and a
  replay-style proof that reconstructs worker completions, panics, stops, and
  replacements from the runtime trace alone.
- Added focused Miri coverage for the SPSC mailbox unsafe slot paths and a
  `make miri` target.
- Added a runtime-owned call effect family at the `tina` boundary:
  `Isolate::Call` associated type and `Effect::Call(I::Call)` variant.
  Trait surface stays substrate-neutral; concrete request/result
  vocabulary lives in runtime crates.
- Added runtime-owned child bootstrap on `ChildDefinition` and
  `RestartableChildDefinition` via `with_initial_message`. The runtime delivers the
  bootstrap message to the new child immediately after spawn (and after
  each restart, for restartable specs), so a parent can hand a child its
  initial kick without test-harness trace introspection.
- Added `tina-runtime`'s first TCP call family on Betelgeuse
  (nightly Rust): `RuntimeCall<M>` carrying a translator from `CallOutput`
  back to `I::Message`, plus `CallInput` covering TCP listener bind,
  accept, stream read, stream write, listener close, and stream close.
  Resources are runtime-assigned opaque ids; raw sockets never escape
  into isolate state.
- Added a Betelgeuse-backed I/O backend in `tina-runtime`:
  caller-owned typed completion slots, synchronous Betelgeuse ops
  (bind / close) finish during dispatch, async ops (accept / recv / send)
  stay in a pending list until their slot has a result, all driven from
  `Runtime::step()` synchronously.
- Pinned tina-rs to nightly Rust via `rust-toolchain.toml` so the Betelgeuse
  substrate's `allocator_api` feature is available; the gate is scoped to
  `tina-runtime` via a crate-level `#![feature(allocator_api)]`.
- Added new runtime trace event kinds for call dispatch attempt, call
  completion, call failure, and rejected-on-stop completion delivery.
- Added focused tests for the call effect path covering invalid resource
  ids and call-id monotonicity, plus a "no call effect" compile-only smoke
  test that shows existing isolates remain ergonomic with
  `type Call = Infallible`.
- Added an assertion-backed live `tcp_echo` integration test: listener
  isolate supervises a restartable connection-handler child spawned via
  `RestartableChildDefinition::with_initial_message`; bytes round-trip end-to-end on
  `127.0.0.1:0` with the runtime reporting the actual bound address; trace evidence is asserted per
  call kind. Separate unit tests prove the connection isolate's
  partial-write retry logic and the `CallCompletionRejected{RequesterClosed}`
  path for a pending `TcpAccept`, plus accepted-stream `peer_addr` reporting.
- Added a runnable `tcp_echo` example mirroring the tested workload with
  inline assertions on echoed payloads.
- Added ordered `Effect::Batch(Vec<Effect<I>>)` at the `tina` boundary and
  runtime support in `tina-runtime` for deterministic left-to-right
  execution with `Stop` short-circuiting later batched effects.
- Added direct batch-semantics tests in `tina-runtime` proving
  left-to-right execution, spawn-plus-send sequencing, and `Stop`
  short-circuit behavior.
- Expanded the live `tcp_echo` proof and runnable example from a one-client
  demo into a small server-shaped workload: listener self-address capture,
  re-armed `TcpAccept`, sequential multi-client handling, bounded overlap,
  graceful listener close/stop, and retained one-client smoke coverage.
- Added a crate-local runtime proof that two accepted stream reads can be
  pending in `IoBackend` at the same time, so the bounded-overlap TCP claim
  is backed by direct runtime evidence rather than only by client-thread
  interleaving.
- Added the first runtime-owned time call verb: `CallInput::Sleep { after }`
  with `CallOutput::TimerFired`, plus `CallKind::Sleep` in the trace vocabulary.
  The runtime samples a monotonic clock once per `step()` and harvests due
  timers against that sampled instant. Equal-deadline timers wake in
  deterministic request order.
- Added a crate-private `ManualClock` seam so timer tests can drive time
  deterministically without brittle wall-clock sleeps, while production
  `Runtime` still uses a real monotonic clock.
- Added focused timer semantics unit tests: single timer wake, no early fire,
  fires exactly once, different-deadline ordering, equal-deadline request-order
  tie-break, and late-completion rejection after requester stop.
- Added a retry/backoff proof workload test: first attempt fails, a
  runtime-owned timer delays a real second attempt, later retry succeeds,
  and the trace proves the backoff `Sleep` completion occurred before the
  retried attempt.
- Added a public-path integration test for the same retry/backoff shape, using
  the shipped monotonic clock rather than the crate-private manual clock seam.

### Phase Voyager

- Added `tina-sim`, the first Voyager simulator crate.
- Added a single-shard virtual-time execution model with deterministic
  event recording against the shipped `tina-runtime` event
  vocabulary.
- Added simulator support for the shipped timer call family:
  `CallInput::Sleep { after }` and `CallOutput::TimerFired`.
- Added replay artifacts containing simulator config, final virtual time,
  and the reproducible event record for one run.
- Added timer-semantics proofs in `tina-sim` covering no-early-wake,
  one-shot wake, different-deadline ordering, equal-deadline request-order
  tie-break, stopped-requester completion rejection, and repeated
  same-config event-record reproduction.
- Added a simulator-backed retry/backoff proof workload and a replay test
  proving that rerunning from the saved config reproduces the same event
  record exactly.
